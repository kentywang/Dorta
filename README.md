### Online Browser Fighting Game 
Dorta is an online multiplayer fighting game made for a hackathon.

### Architecture
For the online-based 'socket' branch of this repository, Dorta is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) using [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) for client-server interaction. The game logic is run server-side, with clients sending their input requests to the server and receiving game states to render. A custom game engine was built using the Canvas API to render the visuals on-screen. 

### Installation
To install Dorta on your computer, you will need [Node.js with NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js with NPM, install the game's dependencies with the following command:
```
npm install
```

When the dependencies have been installed, run the server with the following command:

```
npm start
```

The game will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
